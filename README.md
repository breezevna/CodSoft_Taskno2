# Calculator Program

Welcome to the Calculator program! This program performs basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, square root, factorial, and operations with two square roots or factorials.

## Getting Started

To use the calculator, follow these simple steps:

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the first operand when prompted.
3. Choose an operation by entering the corresponding letter.
4. If the selected operation requires a second operand, enter it when prompted.

## Supported Operations

- **Addition (A/a):** Adds two numbers.
- **Subtraction (S/s):** Subtracts the second number from the first.
- **Multiplication (M/m):** Multiplies two numbers.
- **Division (D/d):** Divides the first number by the second (avoiding division by zero).
- **Exponentiation (E/e):** Raises the first number to the power of the second.
- **Square Root (R):** Calculates the square root of a non-negative number.
- **Factorial (F):** Calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer.
- **Operations with Two Factorials (f):** Performs operations with two factorials.
- **Operations with Two Square Roots (r):** Performs operations with two square roots.

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for invalid input, such as attempting to calculate the square root of a negative number or dividing by zero.

## Examples

Here are some examples of valid inputs:

- To add two numbers: Choose 'A' or 'a' and enter the second number.
- To calculate the square root: Choose 'R' and enter a non-negative number.
- To perform operations with two factorials: Choose 'f' and enter two non-negative integers.

## Notes

- Make sure to enter valid numeric values for operands.
- Follow the on-screen instructions for each operation.
